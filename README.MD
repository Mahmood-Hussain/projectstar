# Project *

## Introduction
This is the official website of Mahmood Kashmiri and Ratan Bunkar for `Project *`, where we showcase our deep learning projects. We are passionate about solving real-world problems using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. In this website, you will find our projects related to audio processing, text generation, and image processing.

# Projects
## Single Singing Voice Separation using Deep Learning
In this project, we have developed a deep learning model that can separate the singing voice from a music track. The model is trained on MUSDBHQ dataset which contains isolated sources of different musical tracks. Our model has good results on this dataset. You can find the source code and details of this project in the "Audio" section of this website.

## Email Writing Assistant using LSTMs Seq2Seq Model
In this project, we have developed a deep learning model that can assist in writing emails. Our model is trained on a large corpus of emails and it can generate email text based on the input provided by the user. The model uses LSTMs and Seq2Seq architecture to generate the email text. You can find the source code and details of this project in the "Text" section of this website.

## More coming soon...
